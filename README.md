# 📊 Project Overview
This project aims to analyse COVID-19 deaths, rates, and trends across various jurisdictions. The project will focus on identifying critical insights such as jurisdictions with the highest death rates, week-over-week percentage changes, and cumulative COVID deaths. Additionally, it aims to compare crude death rates among age groups and calculate percentage changes in COVID metrics over defined periods.

# The project will involve:

+ ##  Identifying Key Trends:
  Jurisdictions with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths for the latest data period.
  Week-over-week percentage changes in crude COVID rates and proportions of total deaths.
  
+ ##  Top Jurisdictions Analysis:
  Ranking jurisdictions by percentage differences in COVID rates.
  Highlighting the jurisdictions with significant increases in weekly COVID deaths.

+ ## Group-Level and Comparative Analysis:
  Analyzing average weekly COVID deaths across jurisdictions and groups.
  Comparing crude COVID death rates across age groups for jurisdictions exceeding a death threshold.

# ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
+ SQL: Data cleaning, querying, and analysis.
+ Power BI: Interactive visualizations and dashboards.

This project provides critical insights into COVID-19 trends by identifying jurisdictions with the highest death rates, analyzing week-over-week changes, and comparing age group impacts.it efficiently calculates key metrics like cumulative deaths and average crude rates. These findings can help inform public health decisions and highlight areas requiring targeted interventions.
